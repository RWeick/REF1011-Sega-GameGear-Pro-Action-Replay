# REF1011-Sega-GameGear-Pro-Action-Replay
The JEDEC PAL dump, ROM dump, and Kicad PCB files for the Sega GameGear Pro Action Replay.

I acquired the ROM dump from the SMS Power forums user Apocalypse.

The PAL dump is made by me; it is a 1:1 of the original and varies slightly from the one made by Apocalypse. This is an actual dump of the chip, not a recreation.

PCB Thickness: 0.8 mm
